The repository is created to host the final project of the course 20236 - Time Series Analysis at Bocconi University (Milan, IT).
The task is to analyze the quality of the air in California during the summer of 2020. The task consists in the proposal of a dynamic linear model to estimate the air quality and its hidden dynamics. 

## First Part
The first part consist in the selection of a location of interest (station 95) and the representation of the time series with meaninful plots as well as the proposal of a simple Gaussian HMM.
